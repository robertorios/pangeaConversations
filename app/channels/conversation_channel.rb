# app/channels/conversation_channel.rb
#
# Frontend Usage:
# 
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Subscribe to ConversationChannel with parameters
#    const conversationKey = "39-40"; // e.g., for conversation between users 39 and 40
#    const subscription = consumer.subscriptions.create(
#      {
#        channel: 'ConversationChannel',        // ‚Üê Always use 'ConversationChannel'
#        conversation_key: conversationKey,      // ‚Üê Pass conversation key as parameter
#        user_id: currentUserId
#      },
#      {
#        connected: () => console.log('Connected to Conversation39-40'),
#        received: (data) => console.log('Message received:', data),
#        disconnected: () => console.log('Disconnected from Conversation39-40')
#      }
#    );
#
# ‚ùå WRONG: Don't try to subscribe to channel names directly
#    consumer.subscriptions.create('Conversation39-40'); // ‚Üê This will cause "Subscription class not found" error
#
# 2. Send message:
#    subscription.perform('receive', {
#      sender_id: 39,
#      receiver_id: 40,
#      message_text: "Hello!"
#    });
#
# 3. Channel naming convention:
#    - Conversation key: "39-40" (always sorted, smaller ID first)
#    - Stream name: "Conversation39-40" (internal, managed by Action Cable)
#    - Both users subscribe to the same ConversationChannel with same conversation_key
#
class ConversationChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
  # This runs when a client attempts to subscribe

    # 1. Ensure the user is authenticated (you'll need to implement this check)
    #    For simplicity, we'll assume the current_user is available through your authentication logic.

    conversation_key = params[:conversation_key]
